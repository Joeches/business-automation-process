- Weekly Email Reminders: Sends reminders every Monday and Thursday at 10:00 AM.
- Monthly Email Reminders: Sends a reminder on the 15th of each month at 9:00 AM.

Requirements
To run this project, ensure you have the following Python packages installed:
- pip install schedule requests

  Code Snippets
Import Required Libraries:
import schedule
import time
import smtplib
import requests

Email Configuration
Define the email sender and recipient information:
# Define the email sender and recipient information
sender_email = 'sender@example.com'
sender_password = 'senderpassword'
recipient_email = 'recipient@example.com'

Email Sending Function
This function sends an email using SMTP:
HTTP Request Function
This function makes HTTP GET requests:

HTTP Request Function
This function makes HTTP GET requests:
# Define the function to make HTTP requests
def make_http_request(url, header={}):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, headers=header)
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f'An error occurred while making the request: {e}')
        return None


Main Function to Schedule Tasks
The main function schedules tasks to run at specified times:
# Define the main function to run the business automation process
def main():
    # Schedule the task to run every day at 8:00 AM
    schedule.every().day.at("08:00").do(send_email, recipient_email, 'Daily Task', 'This is a daily task reminder.')

    # Schedule the task to run every week on Mondays and Thursdays at 10:00 AM
    schedule.every().week.at("Monday, 10:00").do(send_email, recipient_email, 'Weekly Task', 'This is a weekly task reminder.')
    schedule.every().week.at("Thursday, 10:00").do(send_email, recipient_email, 'Weekly Task', 'This is a weekly task reminder.')

    # Schedule the task to run every month on the 15th at 9:00 AM
    schedule.every().month.on("15").at("09:00").do(send_email, recipient_email, 'Monthly Task', 'This is a monthly task reminder.')

    while True:
        schedule.run_pending()
        time.sleep(1)

# Run the main function
main()


How to Run
Update the email configuration with your actual sender and recipient details.
Ensure that your SMTP server settings are correctly configured.
Run the script in your Python environment:

python your_script_name.py

Conclusion
This business automation process project provides a simple yet effective way to manage reminders through automated emails. 
By utilizing Python's scheduling capabilities alongside email functionalities,
